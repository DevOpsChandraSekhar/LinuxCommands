Linux basics & commands

mkdir - create a directory or directories 

examples:
mkdiir csrk 
mkdir cricinfo
mkdir hello 

we can use options like 
-m for sets the access mode for the new directory 
-p if the parent directory doesn't exist it will crate that
-v print a message for each created directory 


mkdir -p csrk/csr1/csr2  it will create the parent directories 
if you want to see either it was created or not use ls -l
